# catIrt
An R Package for Simulating IRT-Based Computerized Adaptive Tests

Functions designed to simulate data that conform to basic unidimensional IRT models (for now 3-parameter binary response models and graded response models) along with Post-Hoc CAT simulations of those models with various item selection methods, ability estimation methods, and termination criteria.
